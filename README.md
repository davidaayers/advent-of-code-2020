# Advent of Code 2020

This year, I'm taking a swim through Typescript. 

To generate this repo, I used [MJGTwo's template](https://github.com/MJGTwo/advent-of-code-nodets-template), which is a fork of [johnbeech's repo](https://github.com/johnbeech/advent-of-code-nodejs-template). Open source, AMIRITE?
